In order to see the overall results of this project, download clean_training_data, the five credit risk models and the model comparison script. After running the script you will be able to see a brief data visualisation of how well each model performed at predicting whether an individual would default on a loan. Model trainer.py displays how the intial data file was cleaned along with how each of the first 4 models were made. Decision threshold tuner.py shows how model 4 was modified to create model 5 whilst credit risk model analysis.py was used to measure how well each model formed in isolation.
